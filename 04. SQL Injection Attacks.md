# SQL Injection (SQLi)

## Definition
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. It occurs when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected and executed on the database.

## How SQL Injection Works
1. A web application takes user input (e.g., a login form, search field, or URL parameter) and directly includes it in a SQL query.
2. If the application fails to properly escape or validate this input, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
3. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or even full control over the database.

## Types of SQL Injection
### 1. Classic (In-band) SQL Injection
- **Union-based SQLi**: Uses the `UNION` operator to combine results from multiple queries, exposing database information.
- **Error-based SQLi**: Forces the database to return error messages, which may contain sensitive information.

### 2. Blind SQL Injection
- **Boolean-based SQLi**: Exploits conditional statements (`IF` or `CASE`) to infer database responses based on changes in application behavior.
- **Time-based SQLi**: Uses database delays (`SLEEP()` in MySQL, `WAITFOR DELAY` in SQL Server) to determine if an injection attempt is successful.

### 3. Out-of-Band SQL Injection
Leverages external interactions, such as sending requests to an attacker's server, to extract data when direct responses aren't available.

## Impact of SQL Injection
### 1. Data Exposure
Attackers can extract sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or personal records.

### 2. Data Manipulation
Attackers can insert, update, or delete database records, leading to data loss or corruption.

### 3. Authentication Bypass
Attackers can log in without valid credentials by modifying authentication queries (e.g., `OR 1=1` always evaluates to true).

### 4. Privilege Escalation
If an application runs queries with high-privileged database users, an attacker might gain administrative access.

### 5. Server Compromise
If SQLi allows execution of system commands (e.g., via `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server), attackers may gain full server control.

### 6. Denial of Service (DoS)
Attackers can use SQLi to create long-running queries or drop entire tables, disrupting application functionality.

## Examples of SQL Injection Attacks
### 1. Authentication Bypass
#### Vulnerable login query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'password';
```
#### Attacker input:
```sql
Username: admin' -- 
Password: (anything)
```
#### Resulting query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'password';
```
Since `--` is a comment in SQL, the password check is ignored, allowing login without authentication.

### 2. Extracting Data Using UNION
#### Vulnerable query:
```sql
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '1';
```
#### Attacker modifies input:
```sql
1 UNION SELECT database(), version();
```
#### Resulting query:
```sql
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '1' UNION SELECT database(), version();
```
This returns the database name and version.

### 3. Deleting Data
#### Malicious input:
```sql
1; DROP TABLE users; --
```
#### Executed query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1'; DROP TABLE users; --
```
This deletes the `users` table.

## Preventing SQL Injection
### 1. Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
Instead of directly concatenating user input into queries, use placeholders:
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (user, pwd))
```

### 2. Use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Hibernate abstract direct SQL execution and prevent injection by handling input safely.

### 3. Limit Database Privileges
Use the **least privilege principle**â€”ensure the web application has only the permissions it needs.

### 4. Input Validation & Allowlisting
Validate input against expected formats and reject malicious patterns.

### 5. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
WAFs can detect and block SQLi attempts before they reach the database.

## What is ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?
ORM is a technique that allows developers to interact with databases using high-level programming constructs instead of writing raw SQL queries. ORM translates object-oriented code into SQL queries, reducing the risk of SQL Injection.

### Example of ORM (Using SQLAlchemy in Python):
```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

# Fetching data safely
user = User.query.filter_by(username='admin').first()
```
This eliminates direct SQL manipulation and prevents SQLi.

## Conclusion
- **SQL Injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities** that can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and application destruction.
- **Using ORMs and prepared statements significantly reduces the risk.**
- **Proper input validation, access control, and logging are essential for security.**
