# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Definition
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make the server initiate requests to arbitrary domains or services, often without the serverâ€™s owner or the victim's knowledge.

## How SSRF Works
1. The attacker provides a URL or address that the vulnerable server processes.
2. The vulnerable application sends a request using server-side resources.
3. The attacker manipulates the request to target internal or external sensitive resources.

## Types of SSRF
- **Internal SSRF:** Targets internal network resources like APIs and databases.
- **Blind SSRF:** No direct response, but impacts can be inferred.
- **External SSRF:** Targets third-party services or external websites.

## Common Targets
- **Localhost/Internal Services:** Accessing metadata services, admin panels, etc.
- **Sensitive Files:** Retrieving configuration files such as `/etc/passwd`.
- **External Resources:** Sending requests to third-party services.

## Impact of SSRF
- Internal network discovery.
- Accessing restricted resources.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- Bypassing security controls.
- Exposing sensitive data.
- Denial of Service (DoS).

## Examples of SSRF Attacks
- **Accessing Internal Services:** Requesting `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to access internal services.
- **Cloud Metadata Exploitation:** Fetching AWS credentials via `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.
- **File Inclusion:** Using `file://` URLs to read system files.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Input Validation:** Allow only whitelisted URLs.
- **Network Segmentation:** Prevent external access to internal resources.
- **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Block local IP access if not needed.
- **Use Proxies/Gateways:** Filter and control outgoing requests.
- **Access Controls:** Restrict internal service access.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Detect abnormal behavior.

## Summary
SSRF is a critical web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to exploit a web application's ability to make requests. Implementing strict validation, access controls, and monitoring can help prevent SSRF attacks.
