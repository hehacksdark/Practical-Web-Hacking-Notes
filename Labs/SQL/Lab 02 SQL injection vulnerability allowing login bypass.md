# Lab: SQL Injection Vulnerability Allowing Login Bypass  

## Overview  
This lab demonstrates how SQL injection can be used to bypass authentication and log in as an administrator.  

## Steps to Exploit  

1. **Intercept the Login Request:**  
   - Open **Burp Suite** and enable the **intercept** feature.  
   - Enter any credentials in the login form and submit the request.  
   - Capture the request in Burp Suite.  

2. **Modify the Username Parameter:**  
   - Locate the **username** parameter in the intercepted request.  
   - Change its value to:  

     ```sql
     administrator'--
     ```  

   - The modified request should look like:  

     ```
     POST /login HTTP/1.1
     Host: vulnerable-website.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     
     username=administrator'--&password=randompassword
     ```  

3. **Forward the Request:**  
   - Click **Forward** in Burp Suite to send the modified request.  
   - If the application is vulnerable, you will be logged in as an **administrator**.  

## Explanation  
- The `--` sequence is a SQL comment that **ignores the rest of the query**, effectively bypassing password verification.  
- If the application constructs the query like this:  

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' -- ' AND password = 'randompassword';
